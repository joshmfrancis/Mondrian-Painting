Use Cases:

 - Graphic design for a website

Problems: 

 - The way I created the rectangles, it is hard to change the colors individually without making unnecessary changes. 

Possible Work Arounds: 

 - Rewrite the code to be based on the coordinates the rectangles start at, instead of the origin (0,0).
